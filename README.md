A blog series about interesting ways to use PostgreSQL to solve business and programming challenges

This series is intended to show you different ways you might use PostgreSQL to solve challenges you might have otherwise tackled with other tools.  This may simplify your development process, consolidate your production platform, or just be a fun diversion.  Hopefully it'll inspire you to think outside the box with PostgreSQL, or, even better, to create a new Postgres extension in the open source community.
